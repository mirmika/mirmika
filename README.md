## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm **Meryem** — a curious and motivated **Java backend developer in training** with a growing passion for **DevOps** and **microservice architectures**.

🎯 I have a solid foundation in Java and recently completed an intensive **DevOps bootcamp**, where I worked with cloud infrastructure, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.  
🌱 I’m currently self-learning **Spring Boot** to strengthen my backend skills and building small projects to apply what I’ve learned.  
⚙️ My goal is to combine backend development with modern DevOps practices to build scalable, cloud-ready applications.
